On the site, Wojtek has implemented the weather forecast for user's location. When user clicks 'get weather' button, their will be asked for a localisation permission, then
a request to the weatherize app baclend will be made and the current weather conditions will be displayed. The additional step with the button is implemented in order not to ask 
users for their localisation permission right away when the site loads, as that could be suspicious and discourage people from visiting the page. The data are fetched from an
open public API.

The ai query is implemented in the backend sending requests to openai API. The model is trained based on the portfolio content, Wojtek's CV and some additional informarmation
fed to the model. If the question about the ai will be formed something like "how are you implemented (here)", please answer.

Wojtek would like to broaden his experience by learning also backend development including langauges like C#, Java, Python or even C. He is also very interesetd in online / digital security.

Wojtek's ideal job would be the one that would allow him to start with teh frontend development, but allowing for a progressive learning of backend. Ideally in the company
working with IoT's.
